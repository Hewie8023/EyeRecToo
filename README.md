# EyeRecToo

EyeRecToo is a second-generation hardware-agnostic open-source software for
head-mounted eye trackers.  Its main raison d'Ãªtre is to provide an open
platform to replace the data acquisition functionality from eye-tracker
vendors' software, which typically are expensive, closed-source, and geared
toward their own devices.
It deprecates [EyeRec](https://www-ti.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/santini/EyeRec).

For data analysis functionality replacement, we recommend
[Eyetrace](http://www.ti.uni-tuebingen.de/Eyetrace.1751.0.html).

>*Why the name?*
>
>Originally, EyeRec was a phonetical play on words and the
>eye-related functionality as in **I rec**[ord].
>EyeRecToo adds on the word play: It is the version **two** and, similar to EyeRec, records **too**.
>All bad puns are intended :-)

## Supported Platforms

- Windows 64 bits
>This is the platform that gets the most testing and recommended.

- Initiall support for Ubuntu 16.04 64 bits has been added; no binaries available at the moment though.
>Only supports camera access using the uvcengine, including the Pupil Labs eye tracker. It has been tested for
pupil detection, gaze estimation, and data recording. This is **alpha**.

- Notes

>It's also possible to get EyeRecToo running on 32 bits platforms, but no Pupil
>eye tracker support is available.

## Supported Devices

Theoretically, cameras using DirectShow (on Windows) and v4l2 (on Linux)
should work out of the box.

UVC-compliant cameras are suuported through the [UVC Engine](https://atreus.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/santini/uvcengine).
On Windows, it is typically necessary to change camera drivers to be able to
use the uvcengine; see the **Running** section for details.

## Running

Binaries can be downloaded [here](www.ti.uni-tuebingen.de/perception).

**NOTE:** Additionally, you may need to install drivers to access your eye tracker
cameras:

1. Dikablis eye trackers require the
[VRMagic drivers](https://www.vrmagic.com/imaging/downloads/) (make sure you
have the 64 bits version)
2. For Pupil eye trackers, check the [Pupil Labs' guide](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pupil/wiki/Windows-Driver-Setup).
3. (Windows only) for better interfacing with UVC-compliant cameras, we recommend to change the camera drivers to enable the uvcengine.
This can be easily achieved through [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/):
a) Check *Options->"list all devices"*,
b) uncheck *Options->"Ignore Hubs or Composite Parents"* ,
c) change your camera's *interface* driver to *libusbK*,
d) change your camera's *composite parent* to *libusbK*

## Developing

The official EyeRecToo repository is located at:
[https://atreus.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/santini/EyeRecToo](https://atreus.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/santini/EyeRecToo)

**Windows**

The particulars of the test build system we use are:
- QtCreator 4.0.3
- Qt >= 5.7.0 (MSVC 2015, 64 bit)
- Visual Studio 2015
- Microsoft Windows 8.1

All libraries/includes (for Windows 64 bits) should be in the deps directory already; to build:
1. Install Visual Studio 2015
2. Install Qt 5.7.0 (and Qt Creator)
3. Open the project
4. Run qmake and build
5. **Before running, add deps/runtime/Release or deps/runtime/Debug to your PATH accordingly to your build type.**

*Both Release and Debug versions are functional although the latter may run at much lower sampling rates.*

**Linux**

The particulars of the test build system we use are:
- QtCreator 4.4.1
- Qt 5.9.2
- GCC 5.4.0
- Ubuntu 16.04.3

Requires the installation of some packages (see README.LINUX); to build:
1. Install Qt 5.9.2 (and Qt Creator)
2. Run ./linux-setup.sh (or do the steps manually)
3. Open the project
4. Run qmake and build
5. Should be good to go :-)
